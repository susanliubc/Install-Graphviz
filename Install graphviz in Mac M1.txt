Installtion of Graphviz on Mac M1

Note: graphviz is a open source software for graph drawing. In particular, make graphs in decision tree in machine learning.

Steps tried but not working:

1. Install it directly using conda install graphviz / pip install graphviz
2. Go to Anaconda navigator to download
3. conda install python-graphviz

Search alternative methods:

1. Homebrew install graphviz:
	. Install homebrew:
		.Copy and paste /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" to terminal
		.Copy and paste eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" to make brew comman available indside the terminal.
		. brew install graphviz
2. Find the path of graphviz and update enviroment variable
	. Check if graphviz is installed and version
	dot -V
	. Check path
	which dot
	. Update environment variable
	vi ~/bash_profile
	export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/dot:$PATH"
   	source .bash_profile

Now graphviz is installed properly, but Anaconda doesn't have this module.

Tried the following two command again, which took longer time and don't work.

1. conda install graphviz
2. conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz (this command took overnight)

Final solution:

pip install graphviz

Anaconda eventurally import this module.

Comment: pip install seems more efficient than conda install. The same situation happened with plotly and cufflins package.
